# Next steps

Small follow-ups left behind by shipped work: something was hidden, stubbed or
postponed, and someone has to come back to it. Each entry says what was done,
why, and what has to happen next.

Bigger workstreams live in [`implementation-plan.md`](./implementation-plan.md);
this file is for the loose ends that don't deserve a workstream item.

## ⚠ Prod moved to BeGet — the runbook's `ssh timeweb` path is a stale copy

**Found 2026-08-15, the hard way.** `obshee-delo.ru` resolves to
**45.130.41.70**, whose reverse is `ssl.dream.beget.com` — BeGet, not Timeweb.
The live install is `ssh od-root` (`obsheedelo_odroot@obsheedelo.beget.tech`),
`~/public_html`, WP 5.5.5, `wp` on `PATH`.

`ssh timeweb ~/public_html` — which [`prod-migration-runbook.md`](./prod-migration-runbook.md)
§2.5 and [`wp-backend.md`](./wp-backend.md) still call prod — is a **full copy
of the same site** (same siteurl, same WP version, DB `cs16182_delo`) that now
serves only `общее-дело.рф`, and only as 301s to the live host. Editing it
changes nothing anyone can see. Two cheap tells, if you're ever unsure which
install you're on:

- `dig +short obshee-delo.ru` against the host's own IPs;
- make a request with a unique query string and grep `~/access_log` for it —
  on the Timeweb copy it never appears.

**Next:** re-verify and correct every prod claim in the runbook and
`wp-backend.md` (paths, WP-CLI invocations, the mu-plugin install in §2.5,
plugin inventory, the `wp-rocket.off-2026-08-14` observation) against the BeGet
install, and note which of them were measured on the copy. Until that's done,
treat "prod" in those docs as "a copy of prod".

The A6 frozen copy is unaffected — it's `WP_LEGACY_BASE`, not a WP-CLI target.

## Footer link «Благотворительная акция» (`/sp/`) — deleted 2026-08-15

**Done at the source, on both tiers.** Not hidden in the frontend any more —
the frontend guard that briefly existed (`HIDDEN_HREFS`) is gone with it.

| Tier | What was deleted | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **prod** (BeGet, `ssh od-root`) | the `<li>` in `widget_text[3]` («ССЫЛКИ», `sidebar_bottom`, instance `text-3`) — 9 `<li>` → 8 | `wp eval-file` + `rocket_clean_domain()` |
| **od-dev** | the `wp:list-item` block in widget `block-32` (`sidebar_bottom`) — 8 links → 7 | REST `PUT /wp/v2/widgets/block-32` |

To restore, paste the markup back into that list (Gutenberg form on od-dev,
bare `<li>` on prod):

```html
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><a href="/sp/">Благотворительная акция</a></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
```

`/sp/` itself still answers 200 and stays reachable through the A6 legacy
fallback; only the link is gone.

**Why.** `/sp/` carries a leyka donation form posting to this WordPress's
`/leyka-process-donation`, and that path has taken no money since 2022-01-05;
donations run on `donation.obshee-delo.ru` and `поддержи.общее-дело.рф` (both
live). Inside the A6 iframe the form is doubly dead — the visitor gets no
error, just nothing, the same failure mode as the newsletter form (#54).

**Measured 2026-08-15:** 1 of 172 legacy pages carries a leyka form (only
`/sp/`) · 1 link to it in all WP menus and widgets · 65 pageviews / 1 entry
visit in 91 days (Metrica, 2026-05-14 → 2026-08-13) — i.e. the pageviews *are*
the footer clicks that were removed.

**Next:**

1. Ask the org whether the «ПРАВИЛЬНЫЕ решения» campaign is still running (the
   page has a budget table, so it was time-boxed).
2. Decide which donation destination is canonical — `donation.obshee-delo.ru`
   or `поддержи.общее-дело.рф`. Both answer 200; the legacy page links the
   second.
3. Then pick for `/sp/`: **301** it to that destination (cheapest) · **put the
   link back**, pointing straight at it · or **rebuild the page natively** with
   an outbound donate CTA, if the campaign is live and the content is worth
   keeping.
4. Then decide leyka — open item 9 under B-PLUGINS in the plan. If donations
   never come back to this WordPress, leyka and its `leyka_donation` /
   `leyka_campaign` CPTs go at plugin cleanup.

**Rule that outlives this entry:** donations must not be routed back through
WordPress — same reasoning as [`newsletter-unisender.md`](./newsletter-unisender.md).
Before assuming `/sp/` is still the only such page, re-scan: pull
`page-sitemap.xml` and grep each page for `leyka-pm-form`.

## Nav item «Заказать материалы» — deleted 2026-08-15

**Done at the source, on both tiers**, so the frontend no longer filters it:
`ЗАКАЗАТЬ МАТЕРИАЛЫ` is out of `HIDDEN_LABELS` in
[`src/shared/config/navOverrides.ts`](../src/shared/config/navOverrides.ts),
which now holds only «ОБЩЕЕДЕЛО-ПРО».

Menu item **27971** — the same id on both installs — was a child of «МАТЕРИАЛЫ»
(parent `20181`, `menu_order` 26) in menu **39** (`footer-navigation`, location
`primary`, the site's main nav), pointing at page **22125**,
`/materials/order-materials/`. Menu 39 went 40 items → 39 on each. Deleted with
`wp menu item delete 27971` on prod and `DELETE /wp/v2/menu-items/27971?force=true`
on od-dev. To restore: re-add page 22125 to menu 39, parent «МАТЕРИАЛЫ»,
position 26.

**Why.** The page is a Contact Form 7 order form, and CF7 mail from this host
lands in spam — the same "quietly lost, not visibly broken" path documented in
[`newsletter-unisender.md`](./newsletter-unisender.md). The page itself still
answers 200 and stays on the A6 fallback.

**Next:** it comes back only with a delivery path that works — the form wired
to something other than host mail, or the page replaced by an address people
can write to. Same decision as the contact forms in that doc; do them together.
